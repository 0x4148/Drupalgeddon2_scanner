# What am I checking out?  
Multithreaded script to scan websites list against Drupalgeddon2  
Basic version coded for personal usage , but no problem from sharing I guess  
I know it can be coded in couple bash lines , but who care???  
Found bug?!  
You're awesome , Fix it or code it from zero am not intending to update a single line in this rep xD  
# Installation and usage  
Read the wiki  
Am kidding , just find the libraries needed by the script , install it and u r ready to go  
I wont write long Readme file which might take time more than the time it took to code this thing
