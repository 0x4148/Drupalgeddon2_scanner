# Drupalgeddon2_scanner
Multithreaded script to scan websites list against 
Basic version coded for personal usage , but no problem from sharing I guess
I know it can be coded in couple bash lines , but who care???
Found bug?!
You're awesome , Fix it or code it from zero am not intending to update a single line in this rep xD
# Installation and usage
Find the libraries needed by the script , install it and u r ready to go
I wont write long Readme file which might take time more than the time it took to code this thing
